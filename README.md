# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
Coding projects completed during The Tech Academy’s Basic C# course.

This repository contains the coding projects I complete while working through The Tech Academy’s Basic C# coursework. As I progress through the program, I will update these projects to reflect new concepts and improvements in my coding skills.

These projects form part of my online coding portfolio and demonstrate my growing proficiency in C#, .NET, and general software development practices.
